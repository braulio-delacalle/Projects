## Documentation for Zopa Project ##

In this project I have developed a loan calculator for a peer to peer lender, in which the borrower will enter the amount to borrow and the calculator will retrieve the requested amount, the interest rate, the monthly repayment and the total repayment.

The foulders in this project are the following:

1. Data: here you will find the data used to run the function. This data changes once the function is run.
2. Notebooks: here you will find the jupiter notebooks used to develop and test the function.
3. Scripts: here you will find the script that is used to call the function from the terminal and a script used to test it.
4. ToolsLoanCalculator: here you can find the final version of the function, named LoanCalculator.py.
    
For more information about how the function work, see the README in the foulder Scripts and ToolsLoanCalculator.
