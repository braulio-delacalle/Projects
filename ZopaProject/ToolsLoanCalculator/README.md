### ToolsLoanCalculator ###
In this foulder you can find the file LoanCalculator.py which contains the final function of this project.

This function that takes 2 arguments has 2 different uses:

1. Return the loan information to the borrower: requested amount, rate, monthly repayment and total repayment.
2. Refill the dataset: once the function is run, the data of the lenders that have lent their money will be romeved from the dataset. If you choose to enter 'True' in this argument the dataset will be refilled with 100 new random rows. In this case the function will return a message 'Bucket filled'.
